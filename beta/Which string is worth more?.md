You will be given two ASCII strings, ```a``` and ```b```. Your task is write a function to determine which one of these strings is "worth" more, and return it.

A string's worth is determined by the sum of its ASCII codepoint indexes. So, for example, the string ```HELLO``` has a value of 372: H is codepoint 72, E 69, L 76, and O is 79. The sum of these values is 372.

In the event of a tie, you should return the first string, i.e. ```a```.

```py
def highest_value(a, b):
    return a if sum(ord(l) for l in a) >= sum(ord(l) for l in b) else b
```
