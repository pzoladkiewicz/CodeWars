##The museum of incredible dull things

The museum of incredible dull things wants to get rid of some exhibitions. Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibitions. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.

However, just as she finished rating all exhibitions, she's off to an important fair, so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the items after one removed the lowest one. Fair enough.

###Task

Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

Don't change the order of the elements that are left.

###Examples

    remove_smallest([1,2,3,4,5]) = [2,3,4,5]
    remove_smallest([5,3,2,1,4]) = [5,3,2,4]
    remove_smallest([2,2,1,2,1]) = [2,2,2,1]
    
```
def remove_smallest(numbers):
    
	numbers.remove(min(numbers)) if len(numbers) > 0 else []
	return numbers
```

    def remove_smallest(numbers):
        if numbers:
            numbers.remove(min(numbers))
        return numbers
